# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and [this changelog format](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## Unreleased

### Added

- [#43](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/43) The package now supports soft-deleting resources. For
  full details on how to apply this to resource schemas, refer to the new *Soft Deleting* chapter in the documentation.
- Multi-resource models are now supported. This allows developers to represent a single model class as multiple
  different JSON:API resource types within an API. Refer to documentation for details of how to implement.
- [#8](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/8) The new `MorphToMany` relation field can now be used to add
  polymorphic to-many relations to a schema. Refer to documentation for details.
- Developers can now type-hint dependencies in their server's `serving()` method.
- Can now manually register request, query and collection query classes using the `RequestResolver::registerRequest()`,
  `RequestResolver::registerQuery()` and `RequestResolver::registerCollectionQuery()` static methods.

## [1.0.0-alpha.4] - 2021-02-27

### Added

- Added missing `jsonapi:authorizer` generator command.
- The Eloquent schema now has `indexQuery` and `relatableQuery` methods. These allow filtering for authorization
  purposes when a list of resources is being retrieved. For instance, it could filter those queries so that only models
  belonging to the authenticated user are returned.
- [#23](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/23) The resource request class now does not need to exist for
  the destroy controller action. Previously the implementation was expecting the resource request class to exist, even
  though delete validation was optional.
- [#24](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/24) Controller actions will now stop executing and return a
  response if one is returned by the *before* action hooks: i.e. `searching`, `reading`, `saving`, `creating`,
  `updating`, `deleting`, `readingRelated<Name>`, `reading<Name>`, `updating<Name>`, `attaching<Name>` and
  `detaching<Name>`.
- [#37](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/37) Can now use constructor dependency injection in `Server`
  classes.
- [#40](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/40) There is now a new `MetaResponse` class that can be used
  when returning meta-only responses. In addition, response classes have been updated to add a `withServer` method. This
  can be used to specify the named server the response should use to encode the JSON:API document. This has to be used
  when returning responses from routes that have not run the JSON:API middleware (i.e. there is no default server
  available via the service container).
- [#9](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/9) The Laravel route registrar is now passed through to
  the `resources`, `relationships` and `actions` callbacks as the second function argument.
- [#36](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/36) Eloquent schemas now support complex singular filter
  logic, via the `Schema::isSingular()` method.
- [#33](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/33) Specification compliance will now reject an incorrect
  resource type in a relationship. For example, if a relationship expects `tags` but the client sends `posts`, the
  request will be rejected with an error message that `posts` are not supported.

### Changed

- [#22](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/22) **BREAKING** The `index` and `store` methods on the
  authorizer contract now receive the model class as their second argument. This is useful for authorizers that are used
  for multiple resource types.
- **BREAKING** When querying or modifying models via the schema repository or store, calls to `using()` must be replaced
  with `withRequest()`. This change was made to make it clearer that the request class can be passed into query
  builders.
- [#28](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/28) The sparse field sets validation rule will now reject
  with a specific message identifying any resource types in the parameter that do not exist.
- [#35](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/35) The `Relation::type()` method must now be used when
  setting the inverse resource type for the relation.

### Fixed

- Optional parameters to generator commands that require values now work correctly. Previously these were incorrectly
  set up as optional parameters that expected no values.
- [#25](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/25) The encoder now correctly handles conditional fields when
  iterating over a resource's relationships.
- [#26](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/26) Fix parsing the `fields` query parameter to field set
  value objects.
- [#34](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/34) Do not require server option when generating a generic
  authorizer with multiple servers present.
- [#29](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/29) Do not reject delete requests without a `Content-Type`
  header.
- [#11](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/11) Fixed iterating over an empty *to-many* generator twice
  in the underlying compound document encoder.

### Deprecated

- The `Relation::inverseType()` method is deprecated and will be removed in `1.0-stable`. Use `Relation::type()`
  instead.

## [1.0.0-alpha.3] - 2021-02-09

### Added

- [#12](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/pull/12) Can now register routes for custom actions on a resource,
  using the `actions()` helper method when registering resources. See the PR for examples.
- The `JsonApiController` now has the Laravel `AuthorizesRequests`, `DispatchesJobs` and `ValidatesRequests` traits
  applied.
- [#6](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/6) Resource class can now use conditional fields in their
  relationships. This works in the same way as conditional attributes: the resource's `when()` and `mergeWhen()` method
  should be used to add conditional relationships.
- [#13](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/13) Added French translations for JSON:API errors generated
  by specification parsing and resource/query parameter validation.
- [#7](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/7) Eloquent schemas now support default eager loading via
  their `$with` property.
- [#15](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/15) When parsing a JSON:API document for compliance with the
  specification, the client will now receive a clearer error message if they submit a *to-one* relationship object for a
  *to-many* relationship (and vice-versa).

### Changed

- [#2](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/2) **BREAKING** Improved the extraction of existing resource
  field values when constructing validation data for update requests:
    - The `existingAttributes()` and `existingRelationships()` methods on the resource request class has been removed.
      If you need to modify the existing values before the client values are merged, implement the `withExisting()`
      method instead. This receives the model and its JSON representation (as an array).
    - The `mustValidate()` method must now be called on a schema relationship field. (Previously this was on the
      resource relation.) By default, belongs-to and morph-to relations will be included when extracting existing
      values; all other relations will not. Use the `mustValidate()` or `notValidated()` method on the schema relation
      to alter whether a relation is included in the extracted values.

## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2021-02-02

### Added

- [#1](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/pull/1)
  Resource classes are now optional. If one is not defined, the implementation falls-back to using the Eloquent schema
  to serialize a model. Eloquent schema fields now have new
  `hidden` and `serializeUsing` methods to customise the serialization of models by the schema.
- Resource classes now support using conditional attributes in their `meta()` method.
- New field classes `ArrayList` and `ArrayHash` have been added, to distinguish between PHP zero-indexed arrays that
  serialize to JSON arrays (`ArrayList`) and PHP associative arrays that serialize to JSON objects (`ArrayHash`). The
  distinction is required because an empty array list can be serialized to `[]` in JSON whereas an empty associative
  array must be serialized to `null` in JSON.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** The JsonApiResource method signatures for the `attributes()`, `relationships()`,
  `meta()`, and `links()` methods have been changed so that they receive the HTTP request as the first (and only)
  parameter. This brings the implementation in line with Laravel's Eloquent resources, which receive the request to
  their `toArray()` method. The slight difference is our implementation allows the request to be `null` - this is to
  cover encoding resources outside of HTTP requests, e.g. queued broadcasting. When upgrading, you will need to either
  delete resource classes (as they are now optional), or update the method signatures on any classes you are retaining.

### Fixed

- [#3](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel/issues/3)
  Example server registration in the published configuration file prevented developer from creating a `v1` server after
  adding this package to their Laravel application.
- Package discovery for sub-packages that have service providers now works correctly.

### Removed

- **BREAKING** The `Arr` schema field has been removed - use the new `ArrayList` or `ArrayHash`
  fields instead.
- **BREAKING** The `uri` method on resource and relationship routes has been removed:
    - The resource type URI can now be set on the resource's schema (using the `$uriType` property).
    - Relationship URIs are now set on the schema field for the relationship (via the `withUriFieldName` method).

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2021-01-25

Initial release.
